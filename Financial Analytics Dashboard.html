        <h1>Financial Analytics Dashboard </h1>
        <p>Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft.
            It aims to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence
            capabilities with an interface simple enough for end-users to create their own reports and dashboards.
        </p>
        <p> Data visualization has the capability to simplify complex facts and figures,
        transforming raw data into actionable business insights.
        Indeed, it just takes a few mouse clicks to create a custom dashboard report if you follow the right steps.
        </p>
        <p>Following this step-by-step tutorial and create your custom dashboard:</p>
        <b>- Step 1: Importing data </b>
        <p>The first task you need to do when you start with creating a dashboard in Power BI is to import data from source files.
        In this case, Dashboard get data from web: <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/income-statement" target="_blank" ><u>https://www.macrotrends.net</u></a>
        </p>
        <b>- Step 2: Formatting </b>
        <p>
            You can select a table or field to perform formatting actions on them.
            If you have fields such as date, time, city, state, percentage value, currency, etc.
            you can change the format or data type.
        </p>

        <b>- Step 3: Modeling </b>
        <p>
            Although the relationships and associations between the tables
            that you load are already created by the Power BIâ€™s engine,
            still you can view and make changes in the data model from the Model tab given on the left horizontal bar.
            The relationships between the two tables are indicated by links joining two common fields.
        </p>
        <b>- Step 4: Choose the right chart for Dashboard </b>
        <p>
            It is important to learn which type of chart will be most suitable for which kind of data.
            If not properly considered, data visualization can become misleading.
        </p>
        <b>- Step 5: Save & publish your dashboard  </b>
        <p>
            Once you have created your dashboard and populated it with insightful charts, click on the Save button on the toolbar. Since Power BI charts are dependent on the Excel data, they will keep updating as the Excel sheet is updated.

You can also publish the dashboard to the Power BI service and share it with your colleagues.
